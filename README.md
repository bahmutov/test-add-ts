A test project for installing Cypress and adding TypeScript support to specs
using [@bahmutov/add-typescript-to-cypress](https://github.com/bahmutov/add-typescript-to-cypress)

All I had to do

- install Cypress `npm i -D cypress`
- scaffold the project by opening it once `$(npm bin)/cypress open`
- `npm i -D @bahmutov/add-typescript-to-cypress typescript`
- start writing TypeScript specs / supporting files like `cypress/integration/spec.ts`
